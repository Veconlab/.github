# Welcome to the Veconlab!

The UVA Department of Economics features an Experimental Economics Laboratory, located in the
basement of Monroe Hall. University students participate in computer-based experiments
investigating auction/gaming behavior and a variety of other topics.

Veconlab Software offers about 60 web-based experiments. These experiments evaluate
behavioral reactions to varying levels of information, opportunities to negotiate, and changing
prices to name a few.

In order to better model real life behavior, student participants receive real cash payments based
on their personal actions in the experiments.

The Lab is run by Professor Charles Holt with the assistance of undergraduate and graduate
students.
